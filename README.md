As a software developer, I have a strong passion for building user-friendly and efficient tools that make coding easier and more accessible. That's why I developed a code compiler and editor that utilizes the Judge-0 and Code Mirror APIs to provide a seamless experience for users. The editor has a range of functionalities, including input/output, downloading, importing, and full screen mode, and supports four different programming languages. Additionally, I implemented Context for state management and Tailwind for design, and used Firebase to enable users to access their code from any device. One of the challenges I faced during this project was ensuring that the compiler could handle various programming languages and code formats, but I was able to overcome this through thorough testing and debugging. The project has received positive feedback from users and has proven to be a valuable tool for helping them write and compile code quickly and easily.
